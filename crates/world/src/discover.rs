//! World layout discovery: find every `.mca` and name its namespace.
//!
//! Rationale: three server families share the `.mca` format but not the
//! directory layout. Vanilla uses one folder (`region/`, `DIM-1/`,
//! `DIM1/`, and since 26.1 `dimensions/minecraft/<name>/`). Bukkit-family
//! servers (Bukkit/Spigot/Paper/Purpur, pre-26.1 layout) split dimensions
//! into `<base>/`, `<base>_nether/DIM-1/`, `<base>_the_end/DIM1/`, where
//! `base` is `level-name` (`world` by default), and give each datapack
//! dimension its own `<base>_<namespace>_<path>/dimensions/<namespace>/<path>/`
//! world folder; Paper 26.1+ migrates to the vanilla layout. Plugin worlds
//! (Multiverse et al.) are arbitrary folders.
//!
//! Namespaces follow one rule: the exact default trio and vanilla trees
//! keep vanilla codes (derivable, history-stable); every other folder gets
//! a stable hash of its root-relative path, so distinct worlds can never
//! silently share coordinates. Non-derivable codes surface
//! `UnknownRegionPath` for missing files instead of writing somewhere
//! wrong; rollback restores those through their discovered folders.
//!
//! Trio detection only runs on container roots (arguments that are not
//! world folders themselves), so a lone nested folder can never steal the
//! vanilla namespace of the root's own content.
